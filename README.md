`beman.scope` is a C++ library provides `scope_guard` facilities. The library conforms to [The Beman Standard](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/BEMAN_STANDARD.md).

**Implements**: [D3610R0 Scope Guard](./paper/scope.org) targeted at C++29.

**Status**: [Under development and not yet ready for production use.](https://github.com/bemanproject/beman/blob/main/docs/BEMAN_LIBRARY_MATURITY_MODEL.md#under-development-and-not-yet-ready-for-production-use)

# Overview

During the C++20 cycle [P0052 Generic Scope Guard and RAII Wrapper for the Standard Library](https://wg21.link/P0052)
added 4 types: `scope_exit`, `scope_fail`, `scope_success`
and `unique_resource` to [LTFSv3](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2022/n4908#scopeguard).

In the intervening time, two standard libraries have implemented support as well as Boost.
With the imperative for safety and security in C++ developers need every tool in the toolbox.
The authors believe it is time to move this facility into the standard.
The paper will re-examine the five year old design and any learning from deployment of the LTFSv3.

## Usage

- [![Compiler Explorer Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try%20it%20on%20Compiler%20Explorer-grey?logo=compilerexplorer&logoColor=67c52a)](https://godbolt.org/z/qMvrsPexd)

The following is an example of using `scope_fail` to trigger and action when the scope
is exited with an exception.  `scope_success` and `scope_exit` provide similar capability
but with different checked conditions on exiting the scope.

```c++
#include <beman/scope/scope.hpp>


    bool triggered = false;
    {
        scope_fail guard([&]() { triggered = true; });
        // no exception thrown
    }
    // triggered == false
    try {
        scope_fail guard([&]() { triggered = true; });

        throw std::runtime_error( "trigger failure" );

    } catch (...) { // expected }

    // triggered == true
```

`unique_resource` is a cutomizeable RAII type similar to `unique_ptr`.

```c++
#include <beman/scope/scope.hpp>

  {
    auto file = beman::scope::unique_resource(
        fopen("example.txt", "w"), // function to acquire the FILE*
        [](FILE* f) {              // function to cleanup on destruction
            if (f) {
                fclose(f); // Release (cleanup) the resource
            }
        }
    );

    // use file via f->
  }

  // Resource is automatically released when `file` goes out of scope
  std::cout << "File has been closed \n";
```

Full runnable examples can be found in `examples/`.

## Integrate beman.scope into your project

Beman.scope is a header-only library that currently relies on TS implementations
and is thus currently available only on g++-13 and up, or clang 19 and up -- in C++20 mode.

Note that modules support is currently tested only on clang++-19 and above and g++-15.

As a header only library no building is required to use in a project -- simply make
the `include` directory available add add the following to your source.

```cpp
#include <beman/scope/scope.hpp>

//modular version

import beman.scope;
```
Withmodules import needs to be after any includes to avoid compilation errors.

## Building beman.scope

Building is only required to run tests and examples. All compilers build and
run `include` based tests. Compilers known to support modules are automatically
detected added to tests.

### Build Dependencies

The library itself has no build dependencies other than Catch2 for testing.
And for building cmake and ninja.  Makefiles are supported in non-modular builds.

Build-time dependencies:

- `cmake`
- `ninja`, `make`, or another CMake-supported build system
  - CMake defaults to "Unix Makefiles" on POSIX systems
- `catch2` for building tests

### How to build beman.scope tests and examples

from root of repo:

```shell
mkdir build; cd build;
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++-15 -DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=26 -G=Ninja
ninja -j 5 -v; ctest
```

or using cmake presets
```shell
cmake --workflow --preset gcc-release
cmake --install build/gcc-release --prefix /opt/beman.scope
```
